## DV-HDR-Hybrid
This script will make a hybrid between Dolby Vision (DV) and HDR videos

## Binaries

* [dovi_tool](https://github.com/quietvoid/dovi_tool)
* [hdr10plus_tool](https://github.com/quietvoid/hdr10plus_tool)
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html)
* [MKVToolNix](https://www.videohelp.com/software/MKVToolNix)

## How to use dvhdr.py

Simply place the binaries in the same folder, save the dolby vision videos as "dv.mkv" and the hdr videos as "hdr10.mkv", then use the following command:

* python dvhdr.py -o fuckpuyo

and if you have done everything correctly it should save the video like this example:

![DVHDR10](https://i.ibb.co/tByxQLW/fucpuyo.png)

## How to use dvhdr10plus.py

It is something similar to what I said above but here only one file will be used which has to be HDR10+ (HDR10Plus) named "hdr10plus.mkv"

* python dvhdr10plus.py -o fuckpuyo2

![DVHDR10+](https://i.ibb.co/tByxQLW/fucpuyo.png)


I have made a quick little update which is as follows:

* The final video will be saved with audio and subtitles that comes with the hdr10/hdr10+ video
* You will be able to delete the extra files or garbage (whatever you want to call it)


I hope this helps you a lot 
(I just did it out of boredom xd)
